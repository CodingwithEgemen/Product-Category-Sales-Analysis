## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance using Google Sheets by combining multiple CSV datasets. 
The objective is to compare sales quantities between the East Coast and West Coast and to identify the impact of weekdays versus weekends on sales behavior.

## 📊 Data Sources
The analysis is based on three datasets:
- **Customers**: customer information, including city data.
- **Products**: product details and categories.
- **Sales**: transactional sales data, including quantity and day of week.

All datasets were imported into Google Sheets and combined using lookup functions.
